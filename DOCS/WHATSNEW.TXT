1.57 2010.11.25.
-new fileformats: AIF, W64 (Wave64), MP4/ALAC, Float64 in AIF,WAV,W64
-new soundcard in DOS version: Ensoniq ES1371/ES1373 (ENS) (SB PCI 16/64/128)
-new options: -bb (enable backbuffer), -bbm (backbuffer megabytes), -mxlo (limiter overflow), -mxmd (mute divisor), 
              -drfc (FTP-client config), -8w (auto codepage setting in win32), -scc (soundcard sub-config)
-modifications/new:
 -UseVariables=3 is the default setting in mpxplay.ini (program saves the desktop/mixer settings in mpxplay.ini)
  (Warning: This option has effect at file/encoder output too! Don't forget to reset the mixer settings (ie: with ctrl-v) before encoding!)
 -key 'E': switch between player and commander mode playlist editor (note: loading of filesize and filedate infos in commander mode depends on the using of Preloadinfo/-inl/-idl/-ipl settings, same like in player mode)
 -new sort modes at ctrl-F1-F4 in commander mode (see readme.txt)
 -CUE: LENGTH and INDEX EE lines have been changed to one "REM MPXPINFO LNMS=nnnn;INDE=nnnn" line (for better compatibility with other players) and it's written at manual playlist savings too (not only at Mpxplay's auto save)
 -CUE: added filesize (FISI), filedate (FIDA) and more precise index begin (INDB) infos
 -sort: new key: filedate (-io 12) (works at playlist only in commander mode or using the new CUE format)
 -DesktopMode new functions: 2. (+4) display all filenames in directory (not only supported audio files); 19. (+524288) display date of directories in directory browser
 -(simple wide stereo) surround has changed to prologic surround (from MX_PLSUR.DLL) in mpxplay.exe (works in hq mode only)
 -desktop button Hq switch has changed to Ln (loudness)
 -removed obsolete -hq commandline option (use HQmode setting in mpxplay.ini)
 -removed H-key (but KeyHQmode1 and KeyHQmode2 still exist in mpxplay.ini)
 -8ucp/8ccp options can set a source/target codepage for the codepage conversion instead of using WinChars/DosChars
 -8ccp option: NUM argument has changed to CPNAME (-8ccp CPNAME) and uses CP437 by default (if the -8 option is not enabled, Mpxplay converts the ISO-8859-2 chars to CP437 automatically, if it can)
 -gray-'/','*' and 'A-','A+' buttons (step-back-album and step-forward-album) work like ctrl-gray-'/','*' (search paralell dir) in directories
 -no crossfade between continuous indexes at end of song (end point of curr index = start point of next index -> fade-out process doesn't start)
 -filecopy: new mode at copy from playlist (alt-F5): copy with subdirectory (create one more subdir level in target dir)
 -filecopy: new button to create target directory if it doesn't exist (in "copy without extension" window)
 -filemove: filename is renamed in playlist, not removed
 -file output (-o) + indexed files (CUE): -oni option is automatically enabled (at wav and bitstream outputs only, has no effect using encoders)
 -CUE loading: main PERFORMER is used for track-performer if the latter not exists (sometimes this is not good, but it's the correct way)
 -FTP/dos: using a new SWSSOCK library instead of WATTCP
 -FTP/win32: added SSL/TLS (ftps,ftpes) support for ftp-client with OpenSSL dlls (http://www.openssl.org)
 -FTP: ftp-client uses passive mode, auto-reconnect, anonym-login and non-utf8 filenames by default (-drfc 7)
 -FTP: added auto-retry (window) to ftp-client (virtual drive) open (ctrl-'f')
 -FTP: filenames in playlist and in commandline with leading "ftp:" (or ftps,ftpes) are opened by the ftp-client (it opens a hidden session for the filename if cannot assign it to an existent one)
 -FTP: saving playlist with ftpdrive-filenames (like "0:\subdir\filename") to an other/local drive, filenames will contain the complete ftp-path (ftp://user:pass@server/subdir/filename) (M3U,CUE only)
 -playlist-save (F2): new switches ([x]) to configure playlist format: UTF text encoding (type is depending on the original format too), fullpath for remote and fullpath for all filenames
 -win32: modified directsound (WDS) config, possible quality improvement
 -win32: optimized desktop handling/writing (spectrum analyser, playlist editor, text-windows) (causes faster file handling too)
-bugfixes: see WHATSNEW.157

-win32 version:
 -better multi-core handling
 -CDW (audio CD playing/ripping) works under WinNT/2K/XP too (added NTSCSI support)
 -partially enabled multichannel support (with OggVorbis decoder and DirectSound output only)
 -increased MaxFilenames to 19999 (from 9999) in mpxplay.ini
