 -added M4V to MP4 extension list (M4V files are displayed in directory browser) (in_mp4.c)
 -demuxing at buffer underrun (au_cards.c, in_file.c, in_mp4.c)
 -aac decoder (the program didn't play some MP4/AAC files) (syntax.c)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
diffs between v1.57 beta 8 and beta 7

 -lowlevel priority window handling (open ftp, file copy/move/del): sometimes the window didn't appear (added a "waiting" window too) (diskfile.c)
 -faster playlist load & save (load: reduced calling to look_extgetch, save: using write buffer) (diskdriv.c, loadlist.c)
 -F5, ctrl-Ins: overflow (and freezing) at full playlist (editlist.c)
 -group select/unselect (alt-'+',alt-'-',ctrl-'-') (editlist.c, string.c)

 -added partial "-8ucp" support for CP932 and "-8ccp" setting for CP932,CP936,CP949,CP950 (but probably the graphical-desktop of Mpxplay will be incorrect in these CPs) (textconv.c)
-bugfixes/modifications:
 -ftp-client modifications/bugfixes (message communication, file and directory handling, DOS (MPXP157T) version uses a new SWSSOCK library instead of WATTCP) (drv_ftp.c, mpxplay.h, mpxp_dos.lnk)
 -F2: wrong auto-listname in directories (clearing old listname from commandline at dir change) (playlist.c)

 -better random play at start (ie: -prn -ds cde) especially under win32 (mixed.c)
 -surround in lq mode (HQmode=0) (fx_surr.c)
 -'l' key in sublist (now it doesn't jump out from sublist, if it doesn't find the file in the playlist) (keyboard.c)
 -xce option is not saved automatically in Desktopmode ("confirm exit" is not enabled always after using -xce option once) (control.c)
 -displaying of startup "Virtual drive error" window caused messy desktop (re-ordered init callings) (control.c, mpxplay.c)

 -CP437 is the default output codepage (-8ccp) (if -8 is not used) (textconv.c)
 -FPL list loading is updated to the structure of Foobar2000 v1.0.1, but it's not backward compatible and loads the filenames only (loadlist.c)

 -8ccp option: NUM argument has changed to CPNAME (-8ccp CPNAME) (control.c, textconv.c)
 -8ucp/8ccp options can set a source/target codepage for the codepage conversion instead of using WinChars/DosChars (textconv.c)
 -F2: saving playlist from directory browser (pressing F2 in a directory), program automatically creates playlistname from parent/up dir (instead of mpxplay.m3u) (savelist.c)
 -FTP: program uses anonymous login if no loginname/password has given (drv_ftp.c)

 -ctrl-f: removed default local testing address (loaddir.c)
-bugfixes:
 -FTP: LIST command handling (if server doesn't support FEAT/MLSD) (drv_ftp.c)
 -FTP: '@' (ie: email address) can be used in loginname/password (host address selector searching from right, not from left) (drv_ftp.c)

 -LoadId3Tag: +8 (prefer list tags) had no effect at LFN->ID3 conv (chkentry.c)
 -F2: wrong savelist-name (*.m3u) after scannig subdirs (F5) for playlist-names (ie: writing *.m3u in the "Source filter") (savelist.c)

 -DesktopMode: new function: 18. display date of directories in directory browser (display.c, loaddir.c)
 -playlist-save (F2): new switches ([x]) to configure playlist format: UTF text encoding (type is depending on the original format too), fullpath for remote and fullpath for all filenames (savelist.c, textwin.c)
 -FTP: filenames in playlist and in commandline with leading "ftp:" (or ftps,ftpes) are opened by the ftp-client (it opens a hidden session for the filename if cannot assign it to an existent one) (drv_ftp.c, chkentry.c, loaddir.c, playlist.c, string.c)
 -FTP: saving playlist with ftpdrive-filenames (like "0:\subdir\filename") to an other/local drive, filenames will contain the complete ftp-path (ftp://user:pass@server/subdir/filename) (M3U,CUE only) (savelist.c, drv_ftp.c)
 -FTP: program gives back the server error responses in the id3-window (drv_ftp.c)
 -50 lines mode handling with -fs option (alt-F9 has nothing effect under WinXP at 50 lines, now it reduces the analyser/buttons field) (display.c)
-bugfixes:
 -FTP: UTF8 switch-off didn't disable the UTF8 on the server side (-drfc 3 has no real effect) (drv_ftp.c)

 -FLAC: handling (skiping) of id3v2 header (couldn't play such files) (in_flac.c)
 -MP3: skiping zeroes (max 256kbytes) at the begin of file (better xing-vbr handling and song-length calculation) (in_mp3.c)
 -OGG: shorter file detection (not till the end of file) (caused very slow autodetection at unknown files) (in_ogg.c)
 -PLS list loading (loadlist.c)
 -startup: song position restore for single files in the (default) StartupEnabled=+16 mode (startup.c)
 -MXU save: UTF text encoding is always disabled (MXU field selector problem) (savelist.c)
 -reseting entry(s) status (unknown/notexists) pressing enter on it (reseting all entries, if all were unknown (and couldn't play anything) -> no need to press ctrl-r to reset playlist entries if media was missing at play start) (chkentry.c, skiplist.c, mpxplay.c)
 -handled some sort/display bugs by added some auto-keys (sort by path\file and index after user-keys) (sortlist.c)
 -manual playlist load & auto playlist save/restore conflict (starting mpxplay with and without listfile argument) (savelist.c, chkentry.c, playlist.h)
 -id3v2 genre number handling (not only "(num)", "num" format too) (tagging.c)
 -CUE and file id3info mixing in non -bp mode (ie: CUE input + encoder-file output with -oat) (skiplist.c)
 -rename-by-id3 function (ctrl-e) with prefer-lists option (Loadid3tag+8) (ie: file rename using an extm3u playlist) (diskfile.c)
 -reopening input file after file/dir move/rename fault (diskfile.c)
 -faster playlist editor refresh at file checking (when sort is disabled) (has visible effect in win32/windowed mode with -ipl option) (display.c, chkentry.c)
 -win32: faster spectrum analyser, volume indicator and id3-scroll (faster surface) (display.c, textdisp.c)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-new:
 -added SSL/TLS (ftps,ftpes) support to FTP-client with OpenSSL library/dlls (in win32 version only) (drv_ftp.c)
 -option: -drfc NUM : FTP-client configuration (NUM: +1 use passive mode, +2 auto reconnect, +4 use UTF8 filenames, default=3) (drv_ftp.c, control.c)
-modifications:
 -FTP-client uses passive mode, does auto-reconnect if connection losts, and doesn't use utf8 filenames by default (drv_ftp.c)
 -added auto-retry (window) to FTP-client (virtual drive) open (ctrl-'f') (loaddir.c)
 -file output (-o) + indexed files (CUE): -oni option is automatically enabled (mpxplay.c)
 -CUE loading: main PERFORMER is used for track-performer if the latter not exists (sometimes this is not good, but it's the correct way) (loadlist.c)
-bugfixes:
 -better/gapless file output (-o) at indexed files (mpxplay.c)
 -editor refresh at skip album back/forward in directories in -inl,-ihl modes (chkentry.c)

 -alt-'+' : if filename/metadata is shorter than select-mask (wildchar_cmp in string.c)
 -saving and loading CUE at non sequential indexes (better handling of INDEX EE and LENGTH commands) (loadlist.c,savelist.c)

 -UseVariables=3 is the default setting in mpxplay.ini (program saves the desktop/mixer settings in mpxplay.ini)
 -gray-'/','*' and 'A-','A+' buttons (step-back-album and step-forward-album) work like ctrl-gray-'/','*' (search paralell dir) in directories (keyboard.c)
 -no crossfade between continuous indexes at end of song (end point of curr index = start point of next index -> fade-out process doesn't start) (mpxplay.c)

-bugfixes:
 -program can handle structure modifications in the [global] section of mpxplay.ini at UseVariables=3 (but still not recommended to break the structure/fields/coloumns) (control.c)
